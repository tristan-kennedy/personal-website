# What I built

This was a top-to-bottom refresh of my portfolio focused on fast loads, legible typography,
and subtle motion cues. Everything is tuned for accessibility and SEO while keeping the
experience lightweight.

# Highlights

- Image optimization and responsive typography
- Reusable layout primitives for future case studies
- Micro-interactions that stay under 60fps
