### Concept

I mapped out a timeline API that accepts keyframes and applies them to a set of trigger elements. The idea is to
compose sections like chapters without hand-writing intersection logic.

### Findings

- IntersectionObserver is enough for most beats
- Avoid chaining transforms on many nodes at once
- Prefetching assets keeps the story flowing
