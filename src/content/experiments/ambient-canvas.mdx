### What I tried

I explored blending pointer velocity into a particle field so the background stays calm until you interact. The
goal was a tactile feel without overwhelming the content above it.

### Notes

- Debounced resize handlers keep the field crisp
- Offloading calculations to a worker prevents jank
- Color ramps stay within the site's accent palette
