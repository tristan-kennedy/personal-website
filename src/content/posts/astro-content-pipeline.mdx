### Why I wrote this

After wiring up multiple collections, I wanted to keep build times lean and the DX smooth. This post captures
the tweaks that helped keep preview and prod speedy.

### Key takeaways

- Lean schemas make refactors easier
- Shared image assets keep bundle sizes down
- Sorting on ISO-like dates avoids brittle parsing
